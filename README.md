Tripago is designed to streamline travel planning by consolidating the key features you need into one easy-to-use app. Whether you're booking flights, finding hotels, or choosing restaurants, Tripago has you covered.

Note: This project is currently in the implementation phase. Key features are being actively developed and refined.

# :rocket: Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up Tripago on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

3. Install dependancies: npm i
4. Create environmental variables: You'll need to create .env files for both the frontend and backend. See the Environment Variables section for more details.
5. Start the servers:
   ```bash
    - frontend (Next.js): npm run dev
   ```
   ```bash
    - backend: npm run backend
   ```
7. Access the app: Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

# :link: Navigation (Temporary)

```bash
Signup: http://localhost:3000/signup
Login: http://localhost:3000/login

```
# :hammer_and_wrench: Built With
Next.js - Frontend framework for React-based apps.
Node.js - Backend runtime for JavaScript.
Express - Web framework for Node.js.
Firebase - Backend services for authentication and data storage.
