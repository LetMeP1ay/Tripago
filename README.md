## Welcome to Tripago!

Your all-in-one travelling app. Tired of jumping between apps to book flight tickets, find accommodation, and choose restaurants? Tripago has you covered. Our app consolidates these features into a single, seamless experience to simplify your travel planning. 


In order to run our awesome app, run the development server and the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run backend
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

As we are currently in the implementation phase, the navigation is not finalized, so in order to move across the app, use those links:

```bash
localhost:3000/signup
localhost:3000/login
localhost:3000/flights -> navigates into localhost:3000/hotels with specific data passed in the link
localhost:3000/stripe
```
